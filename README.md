The project focuses on generating insights into the transportation category in the state of Telangana.

Telangana is one of India's fastest-growing states and is known for its open data policy, with extensive data published online.

As an aspiring data analyst, I am seeking a project involving real-time data to enhance my portfolio.

I aim to analyze Telangana's growth across various sectors and provide valuable insights to the state government to support data-driven decision-making and further the state's development.

I initiated this project by outlining key objectives for analyzing Telangana's stamp registration sector.

The research questions and recommendations file is attached at the end of this article.
